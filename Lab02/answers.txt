Question 1. When accessor method be used ?
Ans: 
- When you want to protect your data of the class
- You want to control your class behavior stricly

Question 2. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to 
    build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
JAVA allows you to do that thanks to overloading method. Howerver, since they have the same data type, you might want to specify
which constructor you are going to use.
